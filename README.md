Hi, it's TalhaPythoneer. I have been working for over 3 years as a Web Scraper and Web Developer. I am an expert in Web Scraping, Data Extraction, building ETL pipelines, and developing responsive websites and Web Applications.

I can scrape any website e.g Dynamic (JavaScript / Ajax-based) websites, Login Required Sites, and IP Blocking Sites using Python. I can provide Scrapped data in CSV, XLSX (Excel or Google sheets), JSON, MongoDB, or any other desired database.

My development skillset revolves around Django and React JS. I have built different web projects including management systems, messengers, ML apps, and one-page portfolios or company websites.
